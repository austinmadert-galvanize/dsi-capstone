# Project Idea 1
## Description
Environmental factors such as weather, wildlife, and watersheds can affect the developing of housing markets. I would be interested in exploring the relationship between these environmental factors and housing market volatility. I would want to understand if the rate of change in housing prices is affected by their environments and to what extent.
## Question to be answered
To what extent do environmental factors determine/impact housing market volatility?
## Presentation
I will use slides to present my work.
## Data Source
I will use NASA environmental data and scrape Zillow property value data.
## Next Steps 
The next step in the project is to acquire datasets and begin understanding impactful environmental factors

# Project Idea 2
## Description
Food waste is a large environmental concern, and spoilage happens at the point of sale. I would like to build a model to predict the demand for food groups within a city (probably Austin), which could be used to mitigate point of sale spoilage.
## Question to be answered
Can food demand trends be predicted and therefore used to reduce food waste?
## Presentation
I will use slides to present my work.
## Data Source
I will use City of Austin datasets
## Next Steps 
The next step in the project is to acquire datasets and begin understanding impactful food waste factors

# Project Idea 3
## Description
Working out is a healthy practice. I would like to build a workout plan recommender that will generate workout recommendations that fit into your schedule and help you keep to your goals.
## Question to be answered
What workout can I do right now that will optimize my performance and fit into my schedule?
## Presentation
I will use slides to present my work as well as a quick recommender demo.
## Data Source
I will be working to identify possible datasets
## Next Steps 
The next step in the project is to acquire datasets and begin understanding how to work on recommender projects.

# Project Idea 4
## Description
I want to predict the most efficient place for city governments to eminent domain if they want to build effective housing projects for homeless/poor. I would be measuring efficiency based on housing value trends (because eminent domain costs are based on a percentage of value). 
## Question to be answered
Where are the most monetarily efficient areas to eminent domain?
## Presentation
I will use slides to present my work.
## Data Source
I will use huduser.gov (Office of Policy Development and Research) and scrape Zillow property value data.
## Next Steps 
The next step in the project is to acquire datasets and begin understanding poverty trends.
