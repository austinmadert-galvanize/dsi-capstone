1) High level description of the project: Environmental factors such as weather, wildlife, and watersheds can affect the developing of housing markets. I would be interested in exploring the relationship between these environmental factors and housing market volatility. I would want to understand if the rate of change in housing prices is affected by their environments and to what extent.
2) Question: To what extent do environmental factors determine/impact housing market volatility?
3) Presentation: Slides
4) Data sources: NASA environmental data and Zillow
5) next steps: Acquire datasets

1) High level description of the project: Food waste is a large environmental concern, and spoilage happens at the point of sale. I would like to build a model to predict the demand for food groups within a city (probably Austin), which could be used to mitigate point of sale spoilage.
2) Question: Can food demand trends be predicted and therefore used to reduce food waste?
3) Presentation: slides
4) Data sources: City of Austin datasets
5) next steps: Acquire datasets

1) High level description of the project: Working out is a healthy practice. I would like to build a workout plan recommender that will generate workout recommendations that fit into your schedule and help you keep to your goals.
2) Question: What workout can I do right now that will optimize my performance and fit into my schedule?
3) Presentation: slides
4) Data sources: Working to identify possible datasets
5) next steps: Acquire datasets
